/**
 * Challenge: set up redux action creators, reducer, and store
 * We'll be building a counter app to start out.
 * Read the comments below for the step-by-step challenges
 */

// 1. Create action creators for having the count "increment" and "decrement"

// 2. Create a reducer to handle your increment and decrement actions

// 3. Create a new Redux store

// 4. Set up the subscribe function so we can more easily see the changes to the Redux state as they happen

// 5. Export the store as a default export
